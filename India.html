            <h1>Air Quality in India</h1>
            <img src="2017-09-India-1998-2014-2015.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="para">
                <p>In recent years, India has implemented a number of initiatives to address air pollution. One such initiative is the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which was launched in January 2019 to reduce air pollution levels across the country. The NCAP aims to reduce particulate matter levels by 20-30% by 2024 and has identified 122 cities as non-attainment cities where air quality standards are not being met. Additionally, the government has taken steps to promote clean energy sources such as solar and wind power, and has implemented stricter regulations on industrial emissions. While there is still a long way to go in improving air quality in India, these efforts have had some positive impact and the situation is slowly improving. It is important for India to continue its efforts towards improving air quality as it has significant impacts on the health and well-being of its citizens..</p>

            <h1>Here are some of the most polluted cities in India</h1>
            <h1>1. Delhi</h1>

            <div>
                <p class="para">Air pollution is a major problem in Delhi, the capital city of India. The city's rapid industrialization, urbanization, and increasing population have led to a significant increase in air pollution levels. During the winter months, when the temperature drops and the wind speed decreases, the situation worsens, and the air quality reaches hazardous levels. Major contributors to the air pollution in Delhi include vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, construction activities, and open burning of agricultural waste. Exposure to high levels of air pollution has been linked to a variety of health problems, including respiratory diseases, heart disease, and stroke. The government and other organizations have taken several measures to control air pollution in Delhi, including the implementation of the odd-even scheme for vehicles, the ban on the use of diesel generators, and the promotion of public transportation. However, more sustained efforts are needed to address this critical issue and protect the health of the city's inhabitants.

            <h1>2. Uttar Pradesh</h1>
            <img src="ghaziabad-ghaziabad-pollution-hindustan-kaushambi-residents-residents_fec22fa8-0577-11e8-987c-1603f9800600.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="para">
                <p>Air pollution is a severe problem in Uttar Pradesh, one of the most populous states in India. The state's rapidly growing population, coupled with high levels of industrialization and transportation, has led to the deterioration of air quality. The region experiences some of the highest levels of air pollution in the world, with dangerous levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particles, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. The state's cities, including the capital city of Lucknow, are among the most polluted in the country. The situation is further exacerbated during the winter months when farmers burn crop residues, leading to a dangerous smog that engulfs the entire region. The government has taken some measures to curb pollution, such as implementing stricter emission norms for industries and vehicles, but more needs to be done to improve the air quality in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

            <h1>3. Bihar</h1>
            <img src="Pollution_1.webp" alt="">
            <div class="para">
                <p>Air pollution is a significant problem in Bihar, a state in eastern India with a rapidly growing population and high levels of industrialization. The state's capital, Patna, has been named as one of the most polluted cities in India, with dangerously high levels of PM2.5 particles in the air. The primary sources of air pollution in Bihar include vehicular emissions, industrial activity, and crop residue burning. Additionally, Bihar experiences high levels of dust and construction activity, contributing to the overall air pollution levels. The state government has implemented measures to combat air pollution, such as promoting electric vehicles and regulating industrial emissions, but more needs to be done to improve air quality in Bihar. Public awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement of pollution control laws are also needed to address this critical issue.

                <p>
                    Air pollution is a significant problem in Haryana, a state in northern India with a high level of industrialization and agricultural activity. The state's major cities, including Gurugram and Faridabad, have some of the highest levels of air pollution in the country, with dangerous levels of PM2.5 particles in the air. The primary sources of air pollution in Haryana are vehicular emissions, industrial activity, construction activity, and crop residue burning. Additionally, the state is situated in the National Capital Region (NCR), which also contributes to the air pollution levels in the state. The government has taken some measures to reduce air pollution, such as promoting the use of cleaner fuels and implementing strict emission norms for industries and vehicles. However, more needs to be done to address this critical issue, including increasing public awareness about the dangers of air pollution and investing in cleaner technologies.

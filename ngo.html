                <h1>Clean Air Task Force</h1>
                <p>CATF cultivated state-based campaigns to urge state and federal action, commissioned and publicized
                    epidemiological studies of coal plant health impacts, and, working closely with attorneys general
                    from affected states, pursued an aggressive federal rule-making campaign and state legislative
                    agenda to force the issue in Congress and the EPA. As a result of our initial efforts even prior to
                    the Obama Administration, coal plants were put on the path to significantly reduce their emissions,
                    saving nearly 13,000 lives per year and avoiding hundreds of thousands of illnesses.</p>

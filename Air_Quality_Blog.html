            <h1>What is Air Quality?</h1>
            <img src="view-thermal-station-distance-clouds-columns-smoke-ecology-idea.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="para">
                <p>Air is one of the most essential entities required for life.But nowadays air pollution has increased
                    so much that even if you do not smoke hten also you will get affected just because of the pollution
                    which acts as a passive smoking.So, that is where the Air Quality Index comes into the matter.An air
                    quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the
                    air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. AQI information is obtained by
                    averaging readings from an air quality sensor, which can increase due to vehicle traffic, forest
                    fires, or anything that can increase air pollution. Pollutants tested include ozone, nitrogen
                    dioxide, sulphur dioxide, among others.
                    Computation of the AQI requires an air pollutant concentration over a specified averaging period,
                    obtained from an air monitor or model. Taken together, concentration and time represent the dose of
                    the air pollutant. Health effects corresponding to a given dose are established by epidemiological
                    research. Air pollutants vary in potency, and the function used to convert from air pollutant
                    concentration to AQI varies by pollutant. Its air quality index values are typically grouped into
                    ranges. Each range is assigned a descriptor, a color code, and a standardized public health
                    advisory.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="medical-banner-with-doctor-patient.jpg" alt="">
            <h1>Health Effects</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="para">Public health risks increase as the AQI rises, especially affecting children, the
                    elderly, and
                    individuals with respiratory or cardiovascular issues. During these times, governmental bodies
                    generally encourage people to reduce physical activity outdoors, or even avoid going out altogether.
                    The use of face masks such as cloth masks may also be recommended.On a day when the AQI is predicted
                    to be elevated due to fine particle pollution, an agency or public health organization might:advise
                    sensitive groups, such as the elderly, children, and those with respiratory or cardiovascular
                    problems, to avoid outdoor exertion.declare an "action day" to encourage voluntary measures to
                    reduce air emissions, such as usingpublic transportation.recommend the use of masks to keep fine
                    particles from entering the lungs[8]During a period of very poor air quality, such as an air
                    pollution episode, when the AQI indicates that acute exposure may cause significant harm to the
                    public health, agencies may invoke emergencyplans that allow them to order major emitters (such as
                    coal burning industries) to curtail emissions until the hazardous conditions abate.</p>

            <h1>Ozone Layer Depletion</h1>
            <div class="para">
                <p>The hole in the ozone layer is caused by air pollutants. Chemicals used as refrigerants, such as
                    chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), contain chlorine atoms. Releasing chlorine atoms into the atmosphere
                    destroys ozone. A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. The ozone layer
                    blocks harmful ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from the Sun — it protects us in a way that is similar
                    to putting sunscreen on your skin to prevent sunburn. The ozone hole puts all living things at risk
                    by increasing the amount of UVB that reaches the surface. Exposure to UVB increases the risk of skin
                    cancer in humans, restricts growth and development in plants, slows the development of fish and
                    amphibians, and reduces the number of phytoplankton in marine ecosystems. UVB also causes natural
                    and synthetic materials to breakdown at an accelerated rate.This year's ozone hole over the Southern
                    Hemisphere showed a maximum area of 24.5 million km² on 26 September (Figure 2) and resembles the
                    one from 2021 (24.8 million km²). The 2022 ozone hole has been similar in size and persistence to
                    the ones in 2021 and 2020, due to a strong and long-lasting polar vortex in those years, according
                    to researchers from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Moreover, the size in 2022 was
                    larger than the average over the last five and ten years (21.3 and 21.9 million km², respectively).
                    In the Northern Hemisphere, ozone depletion is usually much more limited compared to the Southern
                    Hemisphere. In Artic spring 2020, however, ozone-sonde measurements indicated ozone depletion that
                    occurred due to unusually strong, long-lasting cold temperatures in the stratosphere.</p>

            <h1>Harming Animals and Plants</h1>
            <div class="para">
                <p>Wildlife can experience many of the same negative health effects of air pollution that humans do.
                    Damage to respiratory systems is the most common effect on animals, but neurological problems and
                    skin irritations are also common.Plants and crops grow less when exposed to long-term air pollution.
                    Ozone pollution harms plants by damaging structures called stomata, which are tiny pores on the
                    underside of leaves that allow the plant to "breathe." Some types of plants can protect themselves
                    by temporarily closing their stomata or producing antioxidants, but others are particularly
                    sensitive to damage. Between 1980 and 2011, nine billion dollars-worth of soybeans and corn were
                    lost in the US as a result of ozone pollution. When acid rain, lead toxicity, and exposure to
                    nitrogen oxides change the chemical nature of the soil, plants are robbed of the nutrients that they
                    need to grow and survive. This impacts agriculture, forests, and grasslands.There are many other
                    ways that air pollution affects living things, such as damaging the habitat, water, and food sources
                    that plants and animals need to survive.
